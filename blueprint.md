# Smart Tourism App Blueprint

    *   A list of recommended locations, displayed as cards.
    *   A loading indicator that is displayed while the recommendations are being fetched.
    *   An error message that is displayed if there is an error fetching the recommendations.
*   **Styling:**
    *   The application is styled using Tailwind CSS.
